# SparkProject
Final Advanced Programming project.

## Java, Spring + Spark

Make validation and enrichment.

We have a file rawData.txt with the data in specific format.

You have to 

* find out non-valid rows. Say, "no such player", "incorrect time", "code-player inconsistency".

* make enrichment (different file properties among the data) - add several columns, say, the description of the operation, player's team, half-times.
